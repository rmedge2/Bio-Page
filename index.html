                    My name is Rodney Maurice Edge, Jr., but my closest friends call me RJ.
                    I was born in North Carolina, and I was raised primarily in Georgia, so Georgia is what I call home.
                    I grew up in a very musical household, so it came as no surprise during my childhood that
                    I discovered my own passion for music, and I eventually learned how to play
                    several instruments.

                <p>
                    It was during my chdildhood that I also discovered my interest in technology, thanks to the
                    influences of
                    television programs such as "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius" and "Dextor's Laboratory." As such, I used
                    to have
                    aspirations on being ascientist, but I later decided to study electrical engineering. I didn't
                    complete that degree,
                    but now I find myself still learning web development at a DigitalCrafts bootcamp through City of
                    Refuge.
