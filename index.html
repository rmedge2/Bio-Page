                My name is Rodney Maurice Edge, Jr., but my closest friends call me RJ.
                I was born in North Carolina, and I was raised primarily in Georgia, so Georgia is what I call home.
                I grew up in a very musical household, so it came as no surprise during my childhood that
                I discovered my own passion for music, and I eventually learned how to play
                several instruments.

            <p>
                It was during my chdildhood that I also discovered my interest in technology, thanks to the influences of
                television programs such as "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius" and "Dextor's Laboratory." As such, I used to have
                aspirations on being ascientist, but I later decided to study electrical engineering. I didn't complete that degree,
                but now I find myself still learning web development at a DigitalCrafts bootcamp through City of Refuge.
